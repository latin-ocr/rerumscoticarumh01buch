(1) Heffim killed the laird of Melki-
rum, δαΐου, very treacheroussy in Aber-
deen, in the Provost's house, who died
penult. January 1536-7. The following
detail may serve for a further confirmati·
on of what is here mentioned by our au-
thor in general terms. From time im-
memoriul there had been a contra& be-
ttvixt the town of Aberdeen and the lord
Forbes's predecessors', by which the town
was bound to pay lord forbes a tunof
wine per annum, and hc to cause keep
the black fifh of their waters in undne or
forbidden time, and puni1h the flayers
thereos according to law ι but in hiay
1530 the lord For-bes claiming the wine
on account ofa half net'srsalnion fishing
on Don, to which he pretended a right,
tho' it appears he had none, about which
the town writ him a very smart letter,
the quarte] soon rose to such a height
that it came to be debated by the point of
the sword. On the penult ofJuly t'hat
year, being a sabbath-day, a great number
of-the Forbc'ses,headed·by Alexanderfor-
hes younger of Brux, invadedsthe town.
The inhabitants rose in arms to the num-
'ber 20f75oo, chased young-Brux to the
friars place, and there [besieged him for
24 hours 3v and there was blood ssied on
,both fides. 'In the beginning of August
