‚308 RERUM Sco-mnemon

aunem Leontem ad magnas opeS, & honores, ac Regiam etiam affini-x
tatema patre suo proveetum velut ingratum, δε beneficiorum imme-
morem Taoduni in foro capitali supplicio affecit. Annandiani agros
propinquos omni calamitatis genere inter has discordias foedabant.
XXIV. Omnium autem causae malorum in Comitem Duglafliae re}
ferebantur: qui tamen sedulo haec 5 suae factionis popularibus fieri dis-
simulabat : etsi palam unum id studebat, ut divertarum partium ho.-
mines affligeret. Eo enim evaserat impotentiae, ut afta ejus repre-
hendere capitale esset. Iacobum Stuaxtum Regis vitricum de regni
flatu liberius locutum solum vertere coegit : qui 5 Flandris capta na'-
ve non diu supervixit. Jam maturum ratus Levistonios aggredi E.
dimburgum ad conventum evocandos curat (1) Alexandrum familiae'
principem, ejusque filium Iacobum. Item Robertum Regium quaes-‚-
torem, ἃ Davidem. Ex amicis vero Robertum Bruffium‚ Iacobum,
Sc Robertum Dundaflios. Ex his Alexander, δε duo Dundaffii bonis*
publicatis in custodiam Britannodunum sunt relegati : caeteri capiti-¹,
bus luerunt. Qo crimine tam grave meruerint supplicium, 5 scrip-
toribus illorum temporum non proditur. Nec ego in re tam 5 me-
moria nostra remota meas interponam conjeeturas : tantum quod fa-
ma accaepi, referam. Iacobum Levistonium, cum ad locum supplicii
venisset. graviter, δε diserte aiunt de fortunae inconstantia conquestum
patrem suum imperio Regibus proximo nuper auitum ceffiffe libenter
invidioso Proregis titulo ε in sua praedia procul ab aula, & ab inimi-c
corum oculis abiisse, quorum cum nullis ejus miseriis exatiaretui: cru-
delitas, arma, sed coac'tum salutis tuendae causa sumpsisse, Regisque
juffu deposuiffe. Ea in re, fi qua fuerit culpa,jam pridem veniam im-
petrasse. Post id tempus etiam ab omni suspitione se vitam procul e-

Lyon for unthaukfulnefs‚ (as he alledged) sentence. Bo'e‘thius tells us that before

words, say some crines, ought to be in· Elizabeth Moor frequently *urged John
serted lib. 9. at the end of cap. 45. be· Lyon to lye with her, and the mor-e he

cause this slaughter fell ont anno 1 38 2.
They farther observe, that the eatl of
Crawfurd was named James. To confirm
this censure, Mr. Ruddiman refers us to
Bo'e'thius, and imagines that Drummond's
story of one John Lynton, instead os Ly-
on, being killed at Dundee by Alexander
carl of Crawfor'd has missed Buchanan‚
tho' Drummond wrote long after him.
Mr. Ruddiman, who pretended so great
a veneration for the children of Elizabeth
'NIoor‚ and has employed so much learn-
ing and industry in endeavouring to vin-
dicate them from the imputation of bas-
tardy, a thing that did not depend on
them and which they could not help,
was not well advised in referring us to
Boethius, whose story, filling near a folio
page, highly· reflests on Jane one of the
daughters as a young lady l'ost to ssiame,
and tempting a young-man far below her
rank to debauch her,a thing ssie could
have helped, of whichBucbanan says no-
thing, compiizing thissstory in one single

denied she being inflamed with lrust im-
portuned v him the ostener t and that it
was not till he was overcome by her fre-
quent solicitations, that he granted her
desire. The question is whether Bucha-·

nan did wrong in casting several similar Ῑ

events as the ssaughtersof rnen of note
together, without regard to the order of

time, but which happened per ea tem· >

pora, during those times ι Namely wherr'
the earl of Douglas's power at court was

very great, when he struck such a terrdr ,

into Crichton the chancellor‚ and after
that converted his wrath against the Le-'

vingstons 3 and in imputing John Lyon’s ‘

death to Alexander the son and not to
James the father earl of Crawsord, as-
does Boethius ?
