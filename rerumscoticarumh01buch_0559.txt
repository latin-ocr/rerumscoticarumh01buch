vunculus‚ aut alius amicorum ea de re expostulet, aut eam vitro ei
vertat. Nunc enim rebus ita transati‘tis, ut infectae fieri non pollini, .‘
in meliorem partem omnia accepimus 2 & ut est re vera, ita maritus
noster est existimandus, quem dehinc Sc amare, & colere decrevi. Qi-
cunque autem se profitentur nostros amic05, (1) similem erga eum se
profiteri neceffe est, qui insolubili vinculo nobiscum conjunctus est,
Qanquam nonnullis in rebus paulo negligentiuS‚ ac pene temerarie
se gesserit, quod immoderatae erga nos affectioni libenter imputamus,
cupimus tamen ut Rex, Regina, noster avunculus, ac caeteri amici e-
um non minore prosequantur benevolentia, quam fi omnia ad hune·

usque diem ex cort-m praescripto transacta fuiss'ent : eumque contra
promittimus in omnibus, quae ab eo postulabuntur, semper gratificari

paratum(2).''

(1), Here we may either allow an el-
lipse of amicitiam, as amicos nostros goes
immediately before st, er understand it as
put partitively‚ in which case the singular
as well as the plural number is used, as
Plaut. Amphit. ι. 1. 76, 77. pro se quis-
‚que id quod quisque potest, ὃς valet, E-
dit ι ferro ferit :tela frangunt t Id Pseu-
ι101, 3. 2 93, 401st quisque quidque con-
ditum gustaverit, Ipsos fibi faciam ut di-
gitos praerodant suos.

(2) Our author has left out the two
last paragraphs of these instructions to
queen Mary’s trusty counsellor, William
Chisholm bsshop of Dumblane, dated at
Edinburgh the day of May 1567.
which are as follows.

“ Item, in case it {hall be objected to
you by the king, the queen our mother,
our uncle, or any other our friends, that
'our present marriage cannot be lawful,
in respect that he whom withal we are
presently joined, was of before coupled to
a wife ι ye shall reply and answer accor-

 

ding to the very truth, that albeit he was*

before married, yet before our marriage
with him, the former contra& and band
was by the order of law, expreffed in the
canons received and praeiised in our re-
alm, for lawful cause of consanguinity‚
and others relevant, diffolved, and the
process of divorce orderly led ς so that we
on the one part, and he on the other side,
being both free, the marriage might law-
fully and well enough be accomplished

by the laws of this realm, as now atGod's ¹

pleasure it is, whe‘reby the foresaid ob-
jetftiom or any other the like tending to
this fyne [emh] may be clydit and set by.

“ Furthermore, it may be that our un-
cle the cardinal shall objeet and find fault,
that we made not such exact diligence in
convoying hither of the NunceApostolice
as the weight of the matter craved ε In
which point ye shall answer and satisfy

him„ hy* declaration and making οξ true

report, how this last year about Martimea, -„

we directed toward the said Nunce our
well-beloved clerlt and lervitour Mr. Ste-
vin Wilsoun, instrucred with our mind,
whereof the chief intent was, how the
Nunce might be most surely and conve-
niently transported toward our realm,
and to our presence, by the conduct of
our said servitour 3 and yet we saw no ap-
pearance of his coming, but is partly frus-
trate and put by our purpose, for lack of
that support which once we understood of
his haliness⁷ liberality toshave been desti-
nate for us for the maintaining of our e-
state‚and forthsettiug of our authority3 but
chiefly in default of his presence, counsei
and conferente with him, which joined
with the other thing before said, in all
appearance was not only likely to have
furthered and advanced the matter very
highly, but also might have red [rid] us
out of many thrawart [cross] accidents
which sensyne we have fallen into 3 one
of the principa! occasions whereof we
must impute to the said nuncio‘s absence,
and not reforting to us, which has pro-
ceeded on his own motion, and sore a·
gainst our will, as ye {hall make our un-
cle to understand, by all the good and ho-
nest periuafions ye can, tending to ‚this
end.'’ ’

These instructions, which are couched
with much art, will be sufficiently unfol-
ded by the following relation.

Pope Pius V. sent Vincent de Lam-e,
then biffiop of Mondovi‚ afterwards ca! -
dinal, to be his nuncio in scotland, to as-
fist and encourage the queen in her de-
fignaeof bringing back her kingdom to the
obedience of the holy see. He sent by
him‘ 20,000 crowns to her, as an earnestr
offurther supplieS, and wrote to her with
his own hand, June 16. 1566. recom-
mending his nuncio to ber confidence,
Qeen Mary‘s answer bears date the 9:12
