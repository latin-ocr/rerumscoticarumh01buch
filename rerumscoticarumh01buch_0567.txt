LI. Eisdem forte diebus Bothuelius ex intimis ministris unum in
arcein Edimburgensem misit, qui arculam argenteam literis undique
inscriptam, quae indicarent, eam aliquando FrancisCi Regis Franco-
rum suiffe, ad se deferret. ln ea inerant literae Regina: ipsius manu
pene omnes scriptae, in quibus & caedes Regis, ἃ caetera sere-omnia,
quae consecuta sant, dilucide continebantur : ac penein singulis sclip-
tum erat, ut leciae statim cremarentur. Verum BothueliuS, qui Regi:
11ae inconstantiam nosset, ut cujus intra paucos annos plurima viderat
exempla, literas conservarat, ut li qnid difficili cum ea incidill'et, illo
testimonio uteretur, nec se Regiae caedis auctorem, sed comitem faisse
ostenderet. Hanc arculam Bothuelii ministro Balfurius ferendam de-
dit : sed prius principibus'adversae partis admonitiS, qnid, per quern,
& quo mitteretur. Ea deprehensa, multas, magnasque res etsi niag-
n'is suspitionibus jastatas, tamen nondum satis detectas in lucem pro-
tulit, univers-simque crimen pene oculis subjecit.

LII. Bothuelius rebus ubique male cedentibus, omni auxilio, ac
. spe recuperandi regni destitutuS, primum ad Orcadas, deiude ad
Hethlandicas msulas profugit z ibique rerum omnium inopia circum-
ventus piraticam facere coepit. Regina νει-ο, multis orantibus, uti
μ causam suam a Bothuelio separaret (supplicio enim de eo sumpto, fo-
re, ut omnium civium summa voluntate ipsa facile restitueretur) mu-
lier ferox, δε pristinae fortunae spiritus gerenS, ἅτ malis praesentibus ef-
ferata respondit, se libentius cum illo in extremis fortunae adversante
angustini, quam line eo in Regiis delitiis vitam a&uram.(i)

(ι) “ The queen sent the laird of Or·
melion to desire Grange to come and
{peak-‘with her under surety 3 which he
did, after he had acquainted the lords
with hcr delire, and ,had obtained their
permiffion. As he was speaking with her
majesty, the earl ofBothwell had appoint-
ed a soldier to lhoot· him, untill the queen
gave a cry, and said that he would not do
her that shame, seeing that she had pro-
mised that he ihould come and return
fafely. He was declaring unto the queen,
that all of them were ready to honour
and serve her, ,upon condition that she
would abandon the earl ofssothwell, who
had murdered her husband, and could not
be a husband unto her, who had but late-
ly married the earl of Huntly's sister.—
‘she queen sent again for the laird of
Grange, and said to him, that if the lords
would do as he had spoken to her, she
ihopld put away the earl of Bothwell‚
ard come unto them. Whereupon he
alked the lords, ifhe might in their name
make her majesty that promise ς which
they commistioned him to do. Then he
>rode up again, and saw the earl of Both-
well part, and came down again, and as-
sured the lords thereos. They defired
him to go up the hill again, and receive

the queen, who met him. and. said, laird
of Grange‚ I render myselfunto you upon
the conditions you rehearsed unto me in
the name of the lords. Ι Her majesty
was that night convoyed to Edin'ourgh,
and lodged in the midst of the town in.-
the provost's lodging.----That same night
it was alledged that her majesty did write
a letter unto the earl ot‘Bothwell, and
promised a reward to one of her keepers
to convoy it secut-ely to Dumbar unto the
said earl, calling hirn her dcar hcait,
whom ssie should never forget nor aban-
don, tho' she wczs neceffitated to be absent
from him for a time, saving, that she
had sent him away only for his lafety, wil-
ling him to be comforted. and be upon
his guard. Which letter the knave de-
livered to the lords, tho' beliad promised
the contrary ι upon which letter the
lords took occasion to send her to Loeh-
levin to be kept 3 which the alledged
was contrary to promise. They on the
other hand affirmed, that by her own
hand writing she had declared that {he
had not nor would not abandon the carl
ofssothwe11.—· ——In the mean time her
majesty sent aletter to the laird of Grange‚
lamenting her hard usage, and showing
him that promises had been broken to
