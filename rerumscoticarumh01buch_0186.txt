that Eldrecl (or Ethelred) king of Eng-
land had by his ‘first wife Elgiva this Ed-
mund (firnamed Ironfide) afterwards king
of England : thereafter being overcome by
Sweno (or Sweyn) king of the Danes, he
fied into Normandy, and married Emrna
daughter to Richard duke of Normandy.
This queen Emma, Eldred's second wife,
bare to him two sonS, Edward, thereas-
τει- loing, and Alured (or Alfred) whom
he left in Normandy with their grandfa-
ther, and coming over to England, reco—
vered his kingdom, and reigned some
years, but he was killed by Canute. Ed-
mund lronfide his son by the first wife
regained the halfof the kingdom from Ca·
nute, but was killed by his subject and
brother-in-law Edric,leaving two sons,Ed—
ward (sn-named the outlaw) and Edmund
(or, as some call him, Edwin) who lived
and died in Hungary. Edward the eldest
son married Agatha, daughter to the king
of Hungary‚ by whom he had one son,
Edgar Atheling (i. e.*·truly noble, to de-
note, his being of royal blood, of.whom
much is spoken hereafter) and two daugh-
ters, Margaret queen of Scots, sponse to

kingMalcolm Canrnore, and Christian, a·

nun af Wilton. Canute's posterity being.
cut off, earl Goodwin was sent to bring
home thertwo sons of Eldred out of Nor-
mandy‚ where their father'had left them.

thinking, that his elder brother Edmund 2

Ironfide's children were dead. So that we
must distinguiffi the two Edwards, where-

of the one was half-broth er to Edmund 1„
ronfide, called St. Edward, king of Eng- ''
land, the other was his son, and lived and ’

died in Hungary : but his children, Ed-
garA‘theling‚Margaret,andChrissian came
home to Englmul, and thereafter to Scot-
land. But there is no great sear of con-
founding the two Edwards, even tho' we

knew nothing of their history, but what ' ’Δ

our author relates. The former, common-

ly called the confessor, brother to Edmond, .

firnamed Ironfide, Bnchanan‘ tells us, was

at that time an exile inNormandy ς and -

the other Edward, distinguilhed by the sira
name of ontlaw, son of the same Edmond,

in Hungary, married to the daughter ofso- · ς
lomon king of that country. All that our J

author intended by relating this passage of

the Engliss: history, which is connected ..ς
with that of Scotland‚ was to render the ¹, ¹
story of Edgar, th‘e son of this last, ¹the· ‘2'
clearer, who, driven by stress of weather 's-
at sea landed in Scotland, with hisbro- ι

ther and sisters, as hewas defigning to re- ζ.-
turn into Hungary, and whose lister Mar·

garet became queen of Scotland.
