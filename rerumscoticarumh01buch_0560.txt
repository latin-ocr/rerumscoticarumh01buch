of october that year from Edinburgh ε
In it {he acknowledges the pope's favour
and hounty to her z {he adds some high
expreffions of her sense of the pope's zeal
and piety ; and promises to treat his nun-
cio with all respect and confidence. The
nuncio came to Paris in the dog-days,
and brought him who writes his life a·
long with him to be his secretary. He
received letters from the queen of Scots
¹ hy the hands of the archbishop of Glas-
gow, who was then her ambaffador iu
Franco : by these she expressed her desire
that he might come -to Scotland as soon
aa might be3 but wished him to delay
coming, till he should hear from her once
more, that the might have all things pre-
pared for his reception. Upon that he
wrote to her in 3 very vehement stile‚pres-
sing her to ‘zeal and fortitude ofmind, in
carrying on the restoring the catholic re-
ligion in her kingdom ·. with that he sent
her over 4000 crowns, and sent one Ed-
mund Htw, a jesuit, and a man of a cun-
ning and penetrating temper, to be a se-
= eret affistant to her. Three months pas-
sed before Laurea had any intimation
from the queen concerning his coming 0-
ver ε upon which he sent the bishop of
’ Dumblane,‹.vh0 was then atParis,with co-
pious advices to that queen, and continu· '
ed to press her very earnestly by hisletters',
t> admit of his *coming over. The author
of his lite' tells us further, that the queen
held a convention of the estates, and had
obtained two things of them not without
difficulty: the one was, that- her child
should be baptized according to the rites
oftheRoman church3 and the other waS‚
that the pope‘s nuncio should be admitted
with due respetft. Upon this the nuncio
defigned to go to Antwerp, thinking that
the navigation would be safer from thence
than from Calais. But then the author
of his life adds, that such a barbarous
and impious crime was committed in Scot
land, that it gave a horror to think of it,
much more to write of it, meaning‘the.
murder of the king. When this base
murder was known, 'continues he, al!
people were struck with horrour z Some
spoke severely of the queen hereself ; li-
bels were published upon it; and some
having discovered that Bothwell was the
author of this horrid murder, they charg-
ed him as being not only an affaffin‚ but
a cruel hangman. The queen loved him
desperately 3 therefore he in hope to
bev married to her, first divorced hiswife,

 

as if upon adultery that might be so done,
that he might marry another wife, and
then he cruelly contrived the murder of
the king. The queen aster she had born
down some very wicked reports concern-
ing herself and Bothwell, being afraid of
some tumult, that might have been fatal
to them, thought fit to leave Edinburgh ε

¹so she carried hxson with her to Sterlin,

a place of defence 3 having laid (as is pro·
bable) a defigo with Bothwell how mat-
ters were to be managed. A few days afss·
ter she pretended to go out a hunting,
when Bothwell with 200 horse seemed
to surprize her, and to seize her by force.
But the queen coming back with him to
the came, presently made h1m duke of
Orkney, and declared him her husband.
That marriage did not prove happy nor
lasting ε it being a conjunctior} that had-
nothing of the matrimonial dignity in it,
but had sprung from a partnerlhip in an
unworthy crime. The people were uni·
versally enraged against the queen and
Bothwell‚ and their minds wrought up
to a great flame ε therefore a tumultuary
army being iu haste brought together at
Edinburgh, they marched towards Ster-
ling. But when the queen heard that,
she, with a few women, and some ofsher
court went to them. They received her
with due respect ς and being ass<ed why
they came thither armed ? they answere
ed, they came only to punish Bothwell,
for the crimes committed by him, both
in the base and cruel murder of the king,
and in the force he had put upon her
person. The queen justified Bothwell ς
and said, he had done nothing but byher
consent ι this did provoke them to such
a degree os indignation, that they cried

all out, with one voice, Then, Madam‚ ⁴

you shall beffour prisoner. Thus the pupe's
nuncio understood this matter. Thero
are some inconfiderable circumstances in
this relation wrong told, yet the main οὲ
the story agreeing with 'other relations,
shews how falssy this matter ha's been.
fince that time represented, not only by
writers in the church of Rome, but by
many among ourseloes, to put better co-
lours on this odious business. cardinal
Laurea may be supposed to have had the
best information that he· could ⁴ procuro
from those of queen Mary's party, and of
her religion, and he would certainly have.
put the best face poffible on that matter 3
especially after her tragicalk fate, which
raised an universal d'ispofxtion1;i1² 2¹¹ peo- Ι
