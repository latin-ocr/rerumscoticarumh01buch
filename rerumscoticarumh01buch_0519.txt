His father L--,n Mackintosh a man of

who kept his elan strictly to their duty,
was ssain by James Malcomson his reia·
tion, who fled for sanctuary to an isse of
the loch of Rothemorcus ι the rest ofthe
clan apprehended him, and put him and
the partners of his crime to a deserved
death. Upon this the elan chose Hector
Maclntoth, a bastard of the family, for
their chieftain, till his nephew were of

 

fit age, who was the ear} of Murray’s'

care ot’ the Ogssvies, his mother’s relati-,

ous education. Hector was greatly· in-
censed at this, and wanted much to have
the boy in his own power, all being of
the mind that he defigned to destroy him,
that the chieftainfhip might become he-
'reditary to him and his iffue. Hector to

Maclntoffi's son was grown up. This
young gentleman was most eminent for

author in another place, after an account
of Huntly⁷s putting this excellent gentle-

the clanchattan entering the castle of
Pettie by stratagem‚ (having condemned
all his dependers to banishment) seized
and ssew Lachlan Maclntosh as the be-
trayer oftheir chieftain. “ Hunc enim
