XLIII. Cum ab antiquissimis usque ‘temporibus nulli essent in Sco-
tia stati dies, aut certus locus ad judicandum de pecuniariis inter cives
litibus, Ioannes Dux Albinus a Pontifice Romano impetravit, ut surn- ’
ma pecuniae annua, quanta satis esset ad paucorum judicum salarium
'solvendum imperaretur 'Ecclesiastico ordini universo, a singulisque
pro modo census exigeretur. Galvinus Dumbarius Abredonensis
&Episcopus su0‚Scaliorum sacerdotum nornine Pontificem appellavit. Ea
controversia tenuit a quinto Idus Martias usque ad ostavum Calendas
Maia& quo die collegium (1)judicum Edirnburgi constitutum est. Ab
iis cum ab initio multa utiliter essent excogitata, ut jus aequabile dice-
retur, tamen qui sperabatur eventus non est consecutus, Nam cum in
Scotia nullae pene sint leges praeter conventuumdecreta, eaque plae-
taque non in perpetuum, sed in tempus sacta, judicesque, quod‘in ‘se

meeting. Mr. Ruddimau, making a han»-
dle of this passage to reproach our author,

wmony concerning what he observsd in his
time to that of Buchanan, who lived
ssong before him, asserting this charaeter

gratified his spite to Buchanan, (which.
increased with yearS, and with th'e repeat-
ed disappointments of the defigas of a

defeasible right, could not better make
