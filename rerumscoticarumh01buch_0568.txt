had already reproached the lox-ds for the
same, who iheu-ed unto him a letter sent
by her unto the carl osBothwt-ll, promis-
ing, among many other fair and comfor-
table words, never to abandon or forget
him 3 which had stopped his mouth, mar·
velling that her majesty considered not,
that the said earl could never be her law-
ful husband, being so lately before mar-
ried 'with another, whom he had deserted
without any just ground, altho' he had
not been so hated for the murder of the
king her husband. And therefore he re-
quessed her majesty, to put him clean out
of mind 3 seeing otherwise the could never
get the love or respect of her subjects,
nor have that obedience paid her, which
otherwise she might expedi. It contain-

nitions‚which made her bitterly to weep.”
Sir James Melvil's memoirS. This inor-

low quality to keep his company, appears

of his marriage with the queen„ in dis-2
coursing with the gentlewomen, says sir
James, he spoke such filthy language, that
they and 1 left him.” Resides that-after the.
marriage, he treated the queen herselfiu
a brutal manner. “She was so disdainful-'
ly handled,'‘ says the same author, “and
with such reproachful language, that in,
presence of Arthur Aresstine, I heard her,
ask for a knife to stab herself, or else&
said she, lethali drown myself.'’ And in'
another place ε, “ Albeit her majesty was
there, 1 cannot call it her army ; for ma-
ny of those who were with her were of
opinion, that· stre had intelligence with,
the lords, especially such as were inform-
ed of the many indignities put upon her.
by the earl of Bothwell fince their mar-2
riage. He was so beastly and suspicions, .
that he suffered her not to pass one day in,
patience, without making her stied abun-
dance of tears. Thus part of γ his own ⁴
company detested him 3¹ other ¹part of.

fain have been quit 'of him, but thought
