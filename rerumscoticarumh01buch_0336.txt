(1) The laird of Ormiston.

(2) He was first called fir Alexander
Semo, younger son to seton of that iik ι
he married Elizabeth Gordon‚ daughter
and heir to the lord Gord0n‚ and taking
upon him the name of Gordon, was by
king James ΙΙ. made earl of Huntly3 his
son married Jean Stewart‚ fister to king
James ΙΙ. This is Mr. Crawford's note,
which seems to confound the father with
the son and grandson. For in the foedera
Angliae, there is a fase condo& in 1421
for Alexander Seton, lord of Gom-don,
coming into England 3 and next year„
being in Englwd, there is a safe con-
du& for him passing and going toRou-
en, to the presence of μακε, king of
Scots ε and the year aster that a conclu&
for his coming into England to the king's
council. He was one of the host-ages for
the payment of James 1st's ransom, his
yearly rents and poss‘effions being then va-
'lued only at 400 merka whereas those of
Thomas carl of Murray and Alexr. eall
of Crawford were rated each ata 1000.
For tho' Straloch thinks this Alexr. Se·
ton was not married to the heiress, till af·
ter the battle of Harlaw 1411, at which
he was present, yet he must have been too
⁷ sar advanced in years to have been able
to perform such warlike exploits as are

r here ascribed to the earl of Huntly. It

must therefore have been his son Alexan-
der, who ass‘umed the sii-name of Gordon,
and was. created first earl of Hnntly in
1449, that fought the battle of Brechin :
on whom there is an encomium of our
author's which has never yet been print>-
ed, of which I have two copies, one in*
the hand of ΜΓ. Robert Gordon of Stra-
loch, and another sent me from “a gentle·
man in Edinburgh ι And tho' the form-
er wants the penult distich, and in the

’ last line has animam for animum, its ti-

tle seems to be juster than that of the 0—
ther 3 unless we suppose the poem to have
been composed on Alexander the third:
carl, second of the name of Alexander,
who was chancellor to king James IV.
and one of his generals at the battle of
Flowdon, and one of the governors of the
kingdom, during the absence of the duke
of Albany regent to James V. At the
time of this third earl's death, which
happened in 1523, our author was‘about
17 years of age, and if the following epi-
taph was designed for this third earl, it
may have been one of his first effays'in
poetry. Ie was George the second ear),
father of this Alexan the third carl, that
married Jean stema„ daughter to king
James Ι. formerly countess of Augus.

Clausus Alexander jacet hic Gordonius urnss,
