(3) Mr. Crawsord thinks the words

“patri Ioannis Ballioli'' have been omit-
ted by the printer. for it is clear by that

married Dornagilla of Galloway was nc·-

‘³‘ tum filium* are supplied from the MS

‘the former. For he that married Isabel
daughter to David διε. was father to Ro-
bert earl of Carrick, as is clear by the

words themselves. It is to be observed .
